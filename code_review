Things to Improve:


1. Your commits names are poor, always have a meaningful commit name and PR name.
2. Always make small commits and commit names should be relevant to what the code change you have done like fixed some bug, or added config etc etc.
3. Add a lot of comments in your code as it will help anyone to understand what you have done.
4. Try to use OOPs concepts like abstraction in your code to have much more control over the data flow.
5. You can add test cases in your code so if someone else try to change something it shouldnâ€™t break the whole project as a failure in the test case can tell you what is broken.
6. Next time add MVC architecture and try to have a local DB setup atleast to store credentials etc.


Things I liked:

1. You have given proper thought in error handling, most of your code is under try/catch blocks.
2. Have used a decent enough structure to differentiate your codebase in different sections be it DAO or UTILS etc.
3. The class structure and functions have proper meanings which makes it easier to understand.
4. Most of the classes have a constructor, getters and setters.
5. Variable names are thoughtfully chosen and are self explanatory.
6. You have added the exception folder as well and that is really great.
